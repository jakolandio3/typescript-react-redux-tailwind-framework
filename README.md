This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This Project has also been integrated with TailwindCss, Redux and Typescript

## Purpouse

1. Create a template for using React and Redux with Typescript
2. Create re-usable components (Classes or functional Components) for ease of development
3. Provide a reference to structure of Redux and React Apps
4. Provide a Learning tool to build upon
5. Be able to render components on the client side with no Errors or type warnings consistently
6. Fetch data with strict type references and update/delete items on the client side

### Available Scripts

1.`npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.(default on Localhost:3000)

2.`npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
